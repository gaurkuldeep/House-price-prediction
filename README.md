🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

📘 Overview


This project aims to predict house prices based on features such as area, number of rooms, and location using a Linear Regression model.
It demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a supervised machine learning regression model — from data preprocessing to performance evaluation.


🚀 Features


Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with insightful visualizations

Model training using Linear Regression

Evaluation using performance metrics

Prediction of house prices for new/unseen data



🧠 Algorithm Used


Linear Regression — a simple yet powerful statistical method to model the relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (price).

🛠️ Tech Stack
Category	Tools
Programming	Python
Libraries	Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Dataset	House Price Dataset (Kaggle / Custom CSV)
IDE	Jupyter Notebook / VS Code


📊 Workflow

Load Dataset → Import and inspect the housing dataset.

Data Preprocessing → Handle missing values and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Visualize correlations and key trends.

Feature Selection → Choose relevant variables affecting price.

Model Training → Fit the Linear Regression model.

Evaluation → Use R² Score, RMSE, and MAE to assess model performance.

Prediction → Predict house prices for new data inputs.



📈 Results
Metric	Score
R² Score	~0.85
RMSE	~4.3
MAE	~3.5

✅ The model shows good accuracy and linear relationship between key features and house prices.



💡 Insights

Area and number of rooms were found to have the strongest correlation with price.

Outlier removal and normalization improved accuracy.

Linear Regression works effectively for datasets with clear linear relationships.



🏁 Conclusion

This project showcases how Linear Regression can be applied to predict continuous values like house prices.
It emphasizes data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation as key steps in building a reliable ML model.
